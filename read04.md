*i think what the main point we should consider in this chapter is :*

### Why people will visit your website 

*Now that you know who your visitors are, you
need to consider why they are coming. While
some people will simply chance across your
website, most will visit for a specific reason.*

### What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve

*It is unlikely that you will be able to list every
reason why someone visits your site but you
are looking for key tasks and motivations. This
information can help guide your site designs.* 

### Site Maps 

*site maps will be the blueprint of your website , and should be considered carfuly during the work.*
