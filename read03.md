# Git Intro

### Snapshots

*Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — **called commit** — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.*

### Local Repository Structure

The local Git repository has three components:

1. *Working Directory: The actual files reside here.*
2. *Index: The area used for staging*
3. *Head: Points to the most recent commit*
