### Comparison and logical operators:
* Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.
* Functions can take parameters
* An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you
 * JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
String, Number, Math, and Date.

### operators :

(==) compare two vars if they are the same value
(===) compare two vars if they are the same value and type.
(!=) will change the ouput to be false 
(!==) check both that the data type and the value is not the same 

*comparation operators output usualy is true or false means that they allow you 
to compare the result

(&&) and operator : always true else both are false 
(||) OR operator : always false else both are true
(!) NOT operator : chnage the result to the opozit 


### LOOPS :

loops check the code through a condition , if its true the code will run 
till the value is faulse

### type of loops : 
1. for()

This loop will continue to run
for as long as the condition in
the parentheses is true. That
condition is a counter indicating
that, as long as the variable
i remains less than 10, the
statements in the subsequent
code block should run.

2. while()
3. do while()
